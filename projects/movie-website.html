            ## Context
            <p>We learned how to do css code and html code. So we needed to create a movie and use the html and css code. With a partner we needed to create a interesting movie and apply the html and css code. Mueller said we could have done a sequl to get extra credit and get a better grade. </p>
             Content
            <p>Me and my partner first started to get to know each other. We started to plan on what we what wanted to create and needed to create. We started to split the work up and started to communcate towards each other.I did the css coding and my partner did the html coding. I then later did the images and links and he checked the code to make sure no mistakes were made.My partner and us didnt do the extra credit because we had work to do for other classes so we just did the movie webpage and it turned out awesome.</p>
              Reflection
             Challenges 
            <p> Me and my partner couldntr decide on what movie we should have made. But then we later agreed on one. I was helping my partner on the html code because he needed help on the id html coding. My partner talked a lot so i couldnt really be focus on my parrt of the css code. I then later started to work on it in lunch and finish early in my part so i needed to wait for my partner. I was guiding him and we both wanted to make sure everything was good. Me and my partner couldnt do the css font but we got help from other classmates and then our problem was solved and we turned it in.</p>
             Takeaways
            * Communcation
            * Ask peers for help
            * Agree on every part of the project
            * Planing is the most important part
            * Be focus
              Next steps
            <p> My next steps for my project is to make a sequel of the first movie because we didnt have enough time to make a part 2. I would like to add the different characters and their characteristics</p>
